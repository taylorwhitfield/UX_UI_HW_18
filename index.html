                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p><strong>Hello, I’m Taylor Whitfield!</strong> I am a Texas native and have been living in
                    Austin since 2013. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin 
                    with my Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and received my certificate 
                    in UX/UI Design from UT as well. I have an affinity for design and a 
                    knack for working with people. When I’m not spending time with my 
                    dog and cat, you’ll find me watching design videos and honing in on 
                    my skills.<br><br>
                    <strong>Let's Talk!</strong><br>
                    Any questions, feedback or just want to chat, feel free to reach out! Send me an email at <u>taylorswhitfield@gmail.com</u>
